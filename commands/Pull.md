# git pull
Similar to a [git push](./Push.md) a `git pull` will interact with a remote repositroy. Only this time it will **pull** the changes it does not have from the remote down to the local repositroy.

This means any commits made that are on the remote repository will be pull down and added to the local repository.

This can be done by adding the remote name and branch name:

```
git pull orgin main
```

If there is any upstream connection established, you can use ` git pull` without specifying a remote or branch.
